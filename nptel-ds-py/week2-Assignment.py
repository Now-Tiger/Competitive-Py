# Q. 1 - 
#  A positive integer m is a prime product if it can be written as p√óq, where p and q are both primes. .
#  Write a Python function primeproduct(m) that takes an integer m as input and returns True if m is a prime product 
#  and False otherwise. (If m is not positive, your function should return False.)

    x = []

                return True
    return False

print(primeproduct(188))



# Q. 2 - Write a function delchar(s,c) that takes as input strings s and c, where c has length 1 (i.e., a single character), 
# and returns the string obtained by deleting all occurrences of c in s. If c has length other than 1, the function should return s

print(delchar("banana","n"))



# Q.3 - Write a function shuffle(l1,l2) that takes as input two lists, 11 and l2, and returns a list consisting of the first elment in l1, 
# then the first element in l2, then the second element in l2, then the second element in l2, and so on. If the two lists are not of equal length, 
# the remaining elements of the longer list are appended at the end of the shuffled output.
