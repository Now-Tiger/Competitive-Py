__Height / Depth :__

The height of a node in a binary tree is the largest number of edges in a path from a leaf node to a target node. If the target node doesn’t have any other nodes connected to it, the height of that node would be \mathsf{0}. The height of a binary tree is the height of the root node in the whole binary tree. In other words, the height of a binary tree is equal to the largest number of the edges from the root to the most distant leaf node.

A similar concept in a binary tree is the depth of the tree. The depth of a node in a binary tree is the total number of edges from the root node to the target node. Similarly, the depth of a binary tree is the total number of edges from the root node to the most distant leaf node.

One important observation here is that when we calculate the depth of a whole binary tree, it is equivalent to the height of the binary tree.

Firstly, we’re calculating the height of the node C. So, according to the definition, the height of the node C is the largest number of edges in a path from the leaf node to the node C.
