## Introduce yourself 
Well Hi there, good afternoon.
My name is Swapnil Narwade. I'm from Aurangabad (maharashtra).
Recently I've completed my bachelors in Computer Applications from Modern college Pune, with an aggregate of 70%.<br>

I am competition contributor on Kaggle. Basically Kaggle is website/platform where you can go and participate in data science competitions, explore existing projects and what not. Kaggle is a really great platform for anyone who wants to get started in Data Science and ML. 

Currently I am living in Aurangabad with my family. My father is government servant, mother is housewife and have
a little brother who is persuing his bachelors.

Apart my from background I love sports. I enjoy playing cricket and badminton.
So in my free time I always try play cricket or badminton with my friends.

## Why do you want to join this college for masters program ?
I have researched several colleges extensively, and after careful consideration, I am particularly drawn to Symbiosis for several reasons. 
- Firstly, Symbiosis has an outstanding reputation for its academic programs and faculty. The curriculum offered aligns perfectly with my academic interests and career aspirations, providing me with the opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge and skills in my chosen field of study.
