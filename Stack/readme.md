# [Stack Implementation in Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) :

__A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last–In, First–Out) order, i.e., items can be inserted or removed only at one end of it.__

The stack supports the following standard operations:

- __push :__    Pushes an item at the top of the stack.
- __pop :__   Remove and return the item from the top of the stack.
- __peek :__    Returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
- __size :__    Returns the total number of items in the stack.
- __isEmpty :__   Checks whether the stack is empty.
- __isFull :__    Checks whether the stack is full.

The time complexity of all the above operations is constant.
